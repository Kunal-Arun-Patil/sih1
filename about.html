    <p><h2>🐄The Breed Recognition System is an AI-powered application designed to identify animal breeds accurately using images.<br><br>
       🐄By combining computer vision and machine learning, the system analyzes unique features such as shape, color patterns, and facial structure to recognize different breeds.<br><br>
       🐄Our goal is to make breed identification simple, fast, and reliable for everyone — from pet owners and veterinarians to animal shelters and researchers.<br><br>
       🐄This project not only helps in identifying breeds but also creates awareness about breed-specific traits, care, and health concerns.<br><br>
       🐄Our Breed Recognition System uses AI to quickly identify animal breeds from photos. It’s built to support pet lovers, vets, and shelters with accurate and reliable results.<br><br>
       🐄An intelligent system that detects animal breeds by analyzing their unique features. Simple, fast, and useful for anyone working with animals.<br><br>
